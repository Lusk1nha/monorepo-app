# Log Service

The log service is a simple wrapper around the `tracing` and `tracing-subscriber` crates.
It provides a simple way to configure logging for the application.
The service is initialized with a `LogConfig` struct that contains the following fields:

- `log_directory`: The directory where the log files will be stored.
- `file_prefix`: The prefix for the log files.
- `rotation`: The rotation strategy for the log files (e.g., hourly, daily, etc.).
- `default_filter`: The default log level filter for the application.
- `console_filter`: The log level filter for the console output.
- `file_filter`: The log level filter for the file output.
  The service can be initialized with the default configuration by calling `LogService::default()`.
  The log service can be used to log messages at different levels (e.g., info, debug, error, etc.).
